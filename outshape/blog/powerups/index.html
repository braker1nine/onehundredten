In the current version of the game, there are two powerups available to use: Shields and Bombs. Both are used by placing them on a dot, thus changing what happens when an opponent uses that dot in their turn.</p>

<h2 id="shields">Shields</h2>

<div class="screens">

</div>

<p>When you shield a dot, it becomes protected (duh). If an opponent uses one of your shielded dots in their move, they won't take that dot but they will destroy the shield. Essentially it means they have to use that dot in two moves to take it.</p>

<h2 id="bombs">Bombs</h2>

<p>Bombs have slightly higher stakes than shields. If your opponent uses one of your bomb dots in their move, it detonates and gives you the dots above, below, to the left, and to the right.</p>

</div>

<p>Above there's a bomb on the left, and an example of what the board would look like if an opponent hit that bomb</p>

<h2 id="temporaryshields">Temporary Shields</h2>

<p>Okay these aren't really a "powerup" like the other two because you can't just go putting them on dots. Temporary shields show up on dots you own which are also surrounded by dots you own (or are on the edge of the board). So if there's a dot you own (or no dot at all) above, below, to the left, and to the right of a dot you own, that means it's temporarily shielded. This really affects the gameplay in Outshape. You want to try to build groupings of dots that make it hard for your opponent to take them over.</p>

<h2 id="futurepowerups">Future Powerups</h2>

<p>I've been kicking around a couple of other ideas for powerups that I may implement in future versions of the game. If you have any thoughts, I would love to <a href="mailto:outshape@fastmail.fm">hear</a> them.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Time Bombs</strong> - Sort of the opposite of the regular bomb. You lay this down and your opponent has a certain number of turns to use it in their move and thus disarm it. If they don't, it blows up and gives you the dots above, below, to the left, and to the right.</li>
<li><strong>Shape Swap</strong> - This might either allow you to pick a different shape or swap next shapes with your opponent.</li>
