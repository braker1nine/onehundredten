I've gone back and forth and shifted the visual style of various aspects as I've gone along. </p>

<p>Initial designs of the app were made with a dark background. At the time, I was really big into the darker background on Reeder.</p>

<div class="screens">
<img class="screen" src="/images/Board1.png" alt="First Mock"/>
<img class="screen" alt="Refined Version" src="/images/Board2.png"/>
<img class="screen" alt="Main Menu" src="/images/Main%20Menu.png"/>
</div>

<p>The modal-ish views in the app were making heavy use of translucency, as it seemed like the cool thing to do in the earlier days of iOS 7. This was before iOS 8 brought decent APIs, so my solutions for implementing these designs were a bit hacky.</p>

<div class="screens">
<img class="screen" src="/images/Friends%26Powerups.png" alt="Settings"/>
<img class="screen" src="/images/New%20Match.png" alt="New Match"/>
<img class="screen" src="/images/Powerups.png" alt="Powerups"/>
</div>

<p>It's been a long road of missteps and mind changing, so I'm honestly not sure if these next mocks were just a step in the direction of the previous mocks, or a push back against translucency and gradients that led me to the current design. I <em>think</em> it was the latter, but I'm not positive. Regardless, as much as I liked that look, I didn't think it fit the style I was trying to hit.</p>

<div class="screens">
<img class="screen" src="/images/Settings.png" alt="Settings"/>
<img class="screen" src="/images/No%20Games.png" alt="Main Menu"/>
</div>

<p>I took that stark white look, and spent a lot of time figuring out how to work color into it. There was a moment when I was working on the app late one night and <a href="https://justgetflux.com">f.lux</a> had really warmed the colors on my monitor. It dawned on e that I loved what it had done to the app. It looked so much nicer with warmer blues and reds and an offwhite background. So I spend some good time warming up the color palette.</p>

<div class="screens">

<img class="screen" src="/images/UpdatedHome.png" alt="Home"/>
</div>

<p>One of the last design changes I've made is to give the app a little bit of depth. It was always meant to have a simple aesthetic. But I feel like I went too far and it was lacking in any sort of affordances. I've tweaked the buttons to make it clear they're buttons. And I'm still doing some iterating to find places where the design is lacking depth.</p>

<p>The path to Outshape's current design has been years long and full of a lot of ugly. But I think you guys are going to like the final product. And the mocks are an incomplete representation, because the app isn't complete with animations and transitions. But more on that later...</p></div></div><div class="post"><h1 class="post__title"><a href="inspiration">Inspiration</a></h1><div class="content"><p>Outshape was really born out of a love for a couple different iOS games. When the urge to make a game hit me, I was playing a lot of <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dots-a-game-about-connecting/id632285588?mt=8/">Dots</a> and <a href="http://www.atebits.com/letterpress/">Letterpress</a>. What I really started with was the desire to make sort of a two player version of Dots. I wanted to meld those two awesome games into something but I didn't really know what that something looked like.</p>

<h2 id="theinspirers">The Inspirers</h2>

<p>If you're not familiar with Dots, it's a fun little game where you basically draw paths to destroy colored dots. </p>

<p>Letterpress, on the other hand, is a two player word game. You're given a grid of letters and each player takes turns making words with those letters, and by using letters you take control of the tiles. The game ends when the whole board is controlled and whoever controls the most tiles, wins.</p>

<h2 id="thegame">The Game</h2>

<p>In the first versions of the game, it was almost impossible to describe how to play. You had to draw lines between dots and never touch the same color of dot consecutively. Two players took turns drawing lines, and the game ended when all of the dots had been claimed. This was how the game functioned for almost a year I think. Looking back it seems annoyingly complicated.</p>

<p><img src="/images/IMG_0197.jpg" alt="An early mind dump for the game" title="" /></p>

<div class="caption">An early mind dump for the game</div>

<p>I can't remember what sparked the thought, but I realized the game would be way simpler if your turns were restricted to having to draw simple shapes. The game totally changed (har har) when I went down that path. I knew that was what the game would be and everything since then has been refinement and iteration.</p>

<h2 id="goodartistscopygreatartistssteal">Good artists copy, great artists steal</h2>

<p>Outshape is a game inspired by the ideas of other awesome games. But I have this crippling fear that people will look at it and say "It's just a Dots clone". Or even worse, that the Dots developers will feel ripped off. Every time those imposter syndrome-y thoughts pop into my head, I remind myself that I've spent <em>hundreds</em> of hours designing, tweaking, developing, and playing this game. Like many things, it was inspired by those that came before it. But I think (or hope at least) it stands pretty well on it's own.</p></div></div><div class="post"><h1 class="post__title"><a href="welcome">Welcome</a></h1><div class="content"><p>Welcome to the Outshape blog. Over the next few weeks I'm going to write a series of posts about the process of building Outshape. I'm going to share some mocks and design bits. I'm going to talk about aspects of game play. And I'm hoping to share some of the future plans as well. I might even ask for some input on a few decisions I'm mulling over.</p>

<p>You can follow those blog posts here or you can head over to the <a href="/outshape/">landing page</a> to sign up for the email list. I'm hoping to get folks on the email list at launch some free in app powerups and some Outshape swag (who doesn't love stickers...). If that's not doable I will definitely find a way to thank you for your support.</p>

<p>My next udpate is going to be a little dig into the inspiration for Outshape. How playing some of my favorite games inspired me to make my own...</p></div></div></div><script type="text/javascript" src="/scripts/blog.js"></script><div class="emailLink"><a href="/outshape/">Sign up for the email list</a></div><script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.3.min.js"></script><script> (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){
