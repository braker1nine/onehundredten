I've gone back and forth and shifted the visual style of various aspects as I've gone along. </p>

<p>Initial designs of the app were made with a dark background. At the time, I was really big into the darker background on Reeder.</p>

<div class="screens">
<img class="screen" src="/images/Board1.png" alt="First Mock"/>
<img class="screen" alt="Refined Version" src="/images/Board2.png"/>
<img class="screen" alt="Main Menu" src="/images/Main%20Menu.png"/>
</div>

<p>The modal-ish views in the app were making heavy use of translucency, as it seemed like the cool thing to do in the earlier days of iOS 7. This was before iOS 8 brought decent APIs, so my solutions for implementing these designs were a bit hacky.</p>

<div class="screens">
<img class="screen" src="/images/Friends%26Powerups.png" alt="Settings"/>
<img class="screen" src="/images/New%20Match.png" alt="New Match"/>
<img class="screen" src="/images/Powerups.png" alt="Powerups"/>
</div>

<p>It's been a long road of missteps and mind changing, so I'm honestly not sure if these next mocks were just a step in the direction of the previous mocks, or a push back against translucency and gradients that led me to the current design. I <em>think</em> it was the latter, but I'm not positive. Regardless, as much as I liked that look, I didn't think it fit the style I was trying to hit.</p>

<div class="screens">
<img class="screen" src="/images/Settings.png" alt="Settings"/>
<img class="screen" src="/images/No%20Games.png" alt="Main Menu"/>
</div>

<p>I took that stark white look, and spent a lot of time figuring out how to work color into it. There was a moment when I was working on the app late one night and <a href="https://justgetflux.com">f.lux</a> had really warmed the colors on my monitor. It dawned on e that I loved what it had done to the app. It looked so much nicer with warmer blues and reds and an offwhite background. So I spend some good time warming up the color palette.</p>

<div class="screens">
<img class="screen" src="/images/UpdatedGameBoard.png" alt="Game Board"/>
<img class="screen" src="/images/UpdatedHome.png" alt="Home"/>
</div>

<p>One of the last design changes I've made is to give the app a little bit of depth. It was always meant to have a simple aesthetic. But I feel like I went too far and it was lacking in any sort of affordances. I've tweaked the buttons to make it clear they're buttons. And I'm still doing some iterating to find places where the design is lacking depth.</p>

</div>

<p>The path to Outshape's current design has been years long and full of a lot of ugly. But I think you guys are going to like the final product. And the mocks are an incomplete representation, because the app isn't complete with animations and transitions. But more on that later...</p></div></div></div><script type="text/javascript" src="/scripts/blog.js"></script><div class="emailLink"><a href="/outshape/">Sign up for the email list</a></div><!-- Twitter universal website tag code --><script src="/scripts/twitter.js"></script><!-- End Twitter universal website tag code --><script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.3.min.js"></script><script> (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){
