I've had many requests for it and have frequently wished it was available myself. I often end up texting friends I'm playing against with a comment on my last move or theirs. But there are a couple reasons why it isn't something I've put in Outshape. </p>

<p>The first one I'm concerned about is the experience. Playing a game against random people is one thing, but chatting is another. I'm concerned about all of the avenues for abuse that it could open up. That's not something I really want to deal with. It means adding options for blocking users and disabling chat. One of the compromises I was thinking about making was some sort of sticker or emoji based chat. So you couldn't type whatever you wanted in. Just send goofy little images back and forth to express yourself. Because that's what the kids are doing these days.</p>

<p>Maybe the biggest reason I haven't implemented chat is time. I have to be very picky with the features I add if I want to get Outshape released this summer (or this decade). And chat is a big complicated feature with all sorts of potential issues. It's on my list of things to possibly add in after the 1.0 release.</p>
