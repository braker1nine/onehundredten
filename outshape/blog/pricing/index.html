In today’s App Store, there are several ways to monetize applications. For most of it’s life, I’ve considered two options for Outshape: free with some limitations which can be removed by in-app purchase or simply paid up front.</p>

<p>My plan for free looks something like this. Once you have an active game going, you can no longer create games or accept invitations. So you’re essentially limited to one game at a time. In addition won’t earn Joules for winning at the end of a game. I like that this allows you to play a game and even wait until the very end before buying the full version and earning your Joules.</p>

<p>The other option is obviously paid up front. My plan for that would likely be to price the app at $4.99. In terms of App Store pricing, that sounds like a lot to most people I know. But I’ve spent <em>years</em> working on and agonizing over this game. I do not want to sell myself short. If noone buys it at that price I can always adjust my plans.</p>

<p>In addition to the app pricing, I’ve included in app purchases for buying more Joules. (<strong><em>I’m not sure I’ve articulated this in my posts, but Joules are used to acquire more powerups</em></strong>) Those are for the impatient player who just wants to sabotage their friends without earning it. I’m still playing with the pricing and Joule amounts on those. There’s a small chance I may toss the concept entirely as it feels a bit like a money grab and I’m just not sure how I feel about that.</p>

<p><em>What do you think? Freemium or Paid? Is $4.99 too much for you to pay for a game? Do you like purchasing upgrades?</em></p></div></div></div><script type="text/javascript" src="/scripts/blog.js"></script><div class="emailLink"><a href="/outshape/">Sign up for the email list</a></div><!-- Twitter universal website tag code --><script src="/scripts/twitter.js"></script><!-- End Twitter universal website tag code --><script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.3.min.js"></script><script> (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){
