When the urge to make a game hit me, I was playing a lot of <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dots-a-game-about-connecting/id632285588?mt=8/">Dots</a> and <a href="http://www.atebits.com/letterpress/">Letterpress</a>. What I really started with was the desire to make sort of a two player version of Dots. I wanted to meld those two awesome games into something but I didn't really know what that something looked like.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with Dots, it's a fun little game where you basically draw paths to destroy colored dots. </p>

<p>Letterpress, on the other hand, is a two player word game. You're given a grid of letters and each player takes turns making words with those letters, and by using letters you take control of the tiles. The game ends when the whole board is controlled and whoever controls the most tiles, wins.</p>

<h2 id="thegame">The Game</h2>

<p>In the first versions of the game, it was almost impossible to describe how to play. You had to draw lines between dots and never touch the same color of dot consecutively. Two players took turns drawing lines, and the game ended when all of the dots had been claimed. This was how the game functioned for almost a year I think. Looking back it seems annoyingly complicated.</p>

<p>I can't remember what sparked the thought, but I realized the game would be way simpler if your turns were restricted to having to draw simple shapes. The game totally changed (har har) when I went down that path. I knew that was what the game would be and everything since then has been refinement and iteration.</p>

<p>Outshape is a game inspired by the ideas of other awesome games. But I have this crippling fear that people will look at it and say "It's just a Dots clone". Or even worse, that the Dots developers will feel ripped off. Every time those imposter syndrome-y thoughts pop into my head, I remind myself that I've spent <em>hundreds</em> of hours designing, tweaking, developing, and playing this game. Like many things, it was inspired by those that came before it. But I think (or hope at least) it stands pretty well on it's own.</p></div></div></div><script type="text/javascript" src="/scripts/blog.js"></script><div class="emailLink"><a href="/outshape/">Sign up for the email list</a></div><script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.3.min.js"></script><script> (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){
