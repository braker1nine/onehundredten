Game Center provides  an avenue for this through Leaderboards.</p>

<p>Outshape has several different Leaderboards at the moment and I’m still trying to decide on the right combination to provide the most interesting comparisons. The three current leaderboards are…</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Total Joules</strong> - Which is just the total number of Joules earned from matches you’ve won. The more wins and the bigger the wins, the higher you’ll be</li>
<li><strong>Wins</strong> - Very simply the total number of wins you’ve accumulated</li>
<li><strong>Margin</strong> - Maybe the most fun leaderboard. It shows who has the highest cumulative margin of victory. So it’s not just who has the most and biggest wins, but also who has lost less or by smaller margins.</li>
</ul>

<p>One other leaderboard that I’m still contemplating is for winning percentage. But I’m still combing through how many matches should be required or how flexible I should be in displaying it. </p>

<p>One of the drawbacks of the Game Center Leaderboards is they aren’t really designed for cumulative scores. They’re made for games with the concept of a single game “high score”, which doesn’t really fit for Outshape. So after 1.0, I may end up moving the leaderboards out of Game Center so I can customize their behavior a little more.</p></div></div></div><script type="text/javascript" src="/scripts/blog.js"></script><div class="emailLink"><a href="/outshape/">Sign up for the email list</a></div><script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.3.min.js"></script><script> (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){
