There are a lot of hits out there bringing in tons of money, but for every one of those there are hundreds or more that are struggling. One of the problems is pricing in the App Store and the perceptions of what is expensive. I’ll talk more about that soon. </p>

<p>Today I’m going to talk about an alternate way to bring in some revenue: a tip jar. When I first downloaded <a href="http://david-smith.org">David Smith’s</a> <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pedometer++/id712286167?mt=8">Pedometer++</a> and saw this tip jar, I immediately loved the idea. It’s a simple and unobtrusive way for users to show appreciate for the app you’ve built.</p>

<p>One of the things I love about it is users can continue giving. If you add a new feature they really appreciate, then they can give you another tip. It’s also a fairly small amount of work that can really only help. I’m a little worried that Outshape being a paid app will prevent users from giving tips. But if that’s the case, I don’t lose anything. It’s just another way for people to show appreciation for the time and effort put into building Outshape.</p>

<p>Currently the levels of tipping I’m planning to offer are $0.99, $2.99, and $4.99. And I’d really like to put labels on the buttons that describe things I might use the money for. Just to add a little of my personality in there. But I need to make sure it’s not going to result in an App Store rejection. </p>

<p>What do you think? Is tipping a good way to generate some revenue? Or just greedy?</p></div></div></div><script type="text/javascript" src="/scripts/blog.js"></script><div class="emailLink"><a href="/outshape/">Sign up for the email list</a></div><script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.3.min.js"></script><script> (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){
