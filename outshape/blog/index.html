I've had many requests for it and have frequently wished it was available myself. I often end up texting friends I'm playing against with a comment on my last move or theirs. But there are a couple reasons why it isn't something I've put in Outshape. </p>

<p>The first one I'm concerned about is the experience. Playing a game against random people is one thing, but chatting is another. I'm concerned about all of the avenues for abuse that it could open up. That's not something I really want to deal with. It means adding options for blocking users and disabling chat. One of the compromises I was thinking about making was some sort of sticker or emoji based chat. So you couldn't type whatever you wanted in. Just send goofy little images back and forth to express yourself. Because that's what the kids are doing these days.</p>

<p>Maybe the biggest reason I haven't implemented chat is time. I have to be very picky with the features I add if I want to get Outshape released this summer (or this decade). And chat is a big complicated feature with all sorts of potential issues. It's on my list of things to possibly add in after the 1.0 release.</p>

<p><em>What do you think? Is chat important to you? Do you like emojis and stickers? Let me know!</em></p></div></div><div class="post"><h1 class="post__title"><a href="pricing">Pricing</a></h1><span class="post__date">6/18/2015</span><div class="content"><p>One of the most important parts of an app is how much it costs. In today’s App Store, there are several ways to monetize applications. For most of it’s life, I’ve considered two options for Outshape: free with some limitations which can be removed by in-app purchase or simply paid up front.</p>

<p>My plan for free looks something like this. Once you have an active game going, you can no longer create games or accept invitations. So you’re essentially limited to one game at a time. In addition won’t earn Joules for winning at the end of a game. I like that this allows you to play a game and even wait until the very end before buying the full version and earning your Joules.</p>

<p>The other option is obviously paid up front. My plan for that would likely be to price the app at $4.99. In terms of App Store pricing, that sounds like a lot to most people I know. But I’ve spent <em>years</em> working on and agonizing over this game. I do not want to sell myself short. If noone buys it at that price I can always adjust my plans.</p>

<p>In addition to the app pricing, I’ve included in app purchases for buying more Joules. (<strong><em>I’m not sure I’ve articulated this in my posts, but Joules are used to acquire more powerups</em></strong>) Those are for the impatient player who just wants to sabotage their friends without earning it. I’m still playing with the pricing and Joule amounts on those. There’s a small chance I may toss the concept entirely as it feels a bit like a money grab and I’m just not sure how I feel about that.</p>

<p><em>What do you think? Freemium or Paid? Is $4.99 too much for you to pay for a game? Do you like purchasing upgrades?</em></p></div></div><div class="post"><h1 class="post__title"><a href="tip-jar">The Tip Jar</a></h1><span class="post__date">6/15/2015</span><div class="content"><p>It’s no secret, the App Store is a tough place to make a profit. There are a lot of hits out there bringing in tons of money, but for every one of those there are hundreds or more that are struggling. One of the problems is pricing in the App Store and the perceptions of what is expensive. I’ll talk more about that soon. </p>

<p>Today I’m going to talk about an alternate way to bring in some revenue: a tip jar. When I first downloaded <a href="http://david-smith.org">David Smith’s</a> <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pedometer++/id712286167?mt=8">Pedometer++</a> and saw this tip jar, I immediately loved the idea. It’s a simple and unobtrusive way for users to show appreciate for the app you’ve built.</p>

<div class="screens"><img src="/images/IMG_0500.PNG" class="screen"></div>

<p>One of the things I love about it is users can continue giving. If you add a new feature they really appreciate, then they can give you another tip. It’s also a fairly small amount of work that can really only help. I’m a little worried that Outshape being a paid app will prevent users from giving tips. But if that’s the case, I don’t lose anything. It’s just another way for people to show appreciation for the time and effort put into building Outshape.</p>

<div class="screens"><img src="/images/IMG_0499.PNG" class="screen"></div>

<p>Currently the levels of tipping I’m planning to offer are $0.99, $2.99, and $4.99. And I’d really like to put labels on the buttons that describe things I might use the money for. Just to add a little of my personality in there. But I need to make sure it’s not going to result in an App Store rejection. </p>

<p>What do you think? Is tipping a good way to generate some revenue? Or just greedy?</p></div></div><div class="post"><h1 class="post__title"><a href="leaderboards">Leaderboards</a></h1><span class="post__date">6/8/2015</span><div class="content"><div class="screens">
<img alt="Leaderboards" src="/images/IMG_0472.jpg" class="screen"/>
</div>

<p>One of the fun parts of playing a game is being able to compete and compare your results with your friends. Game Center provides  an avenue for this through Leaderboards.</p>

<p>Outshape has several different Leaderboards at the moment and I’m still trying to decide on the right combination to provide the most interesting comparisons. The three current leaderboards are…</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Total Joules</strong> - Which is just the total number of Joules earned from matches you’ve won. The more wins and the bigger the wins, the higher you’ll be</li>
<li><strong>Wins</strong> - Very simply the total number of wins you’ve accumulated</li>
<li><strong>Margin</strong> - Maybe the most fun leaderboard. It shows who has the highest cumulative margin of victory. So it’s not just who has the most and biggest wins, but also who has lost less or by smaller margins.</li>
</ul>

<div class="screens">
<img alt="Margin Leaderboard" src="/images/IMG_0473.jpg" class="screen"/>
</div>

<p>One other leaderboard that I’m still contemplating is for winning percentage. But I’m still combing through how many matches should be required or how flexible I should be in displaying it.</p>

<p>One of the drawbacks of the Game Center Leaderboards is they aren’t really designed for cumulative scores. They’re made for games with the concept of a single game “high score”, which doesn’t really fit for Outshape. So after 1.0, I may end up moving the leaderboards out of Game Center so I can customize their behavior a little more.</p></div></div><div class="post"><h1 class="post__title"><a href="powerups">Powerups</a></h1><span class="post__date">5/5/2015</span><div class="content"><p>One of the key gameplay tactics in Outshape is the use of powerups. In the current version of the game, there are two powerups available to use: Shields and Bombs. Both are used by placing them on a dot, thus changing what happens when an opponent uses that dot in their turn.</p>

<h2 id="shields">Shields</h2>

<div class="screens">
    <img class="screen" alt="Shield" src="/images/powerups/shield.jpg"/>
</div>

<p>When you shield a dot, it becomes protected (duh). If an opponent uses one of your shielded dots in their move, they won't take that dot but they will destroy the shield. Essentially it means they have to use that dot in two moves to take it.</p>

<h2 id="bombs">Bombs</h2>

<p>Bombs have slightly higher stakes than shields. If your opponent uses one of your bomb dots in their move, it detonates and gives you the dots above, below, to the left, and to the right.</p>

<div class="screens">
<img class="screen" alt="Bomb" src="/images/powerups/Bomb.jpg" />
<img class="screen" alt="Bomb Exploded" src="/images/powerups/BombEx.jpg" />
</div>

<p>Above there's a bomb on the left, and an example of what the board would look like if an opponent hit that bomb</p>

<h2 id="temporaryshields">Temporary Shields</h2>

<p>Okay these aren't really a "powerup" like the other two because you can't just go putting them on dots. Temporary shields show up on dots you own which are also surrounded by dots you own (or are on the edge of the board). So if there's a dot you own (or no dot at all) above, below, to the left, and to the right of a dot you own, that means it's temporarily shielded. This really affects the gameplay in Outshape. You want to try to build groupings of dots that make it hard for your opponent to take them over.</p>

<div class="screens">
    <img class="screen" alt="Temporary Shields" src="/images/powerups/TemporaryShield.jpg"/>
</div>

<h2 id="futurepowerups">Future Powerups</h2>

<p>I've been kicking around a couple of other ideas for powerups that I may implement in future versions of the game. If you have any thoughts, I would love to <a href="mailto:outshape@fastmail.fm">hear</a> them.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Time Bombs</strong> - Sort of the opposite of the regular bomb. You lay this down and your opponent has a certain number of turns to use it in their move and thus disarm it. If they don't, it blows up and gives you the dots above, below, to the left, and to the right.</li>
<li><strong>Shape Swap</strong> - This might either allow you to pick a different shape or swap next shapes with your opponent.</li>
</ul></div></div><div class="post"><h1 class="post__title"><a href="designing">Designing Outshape</a></h1><span class="post__date">4/21/2015</span><div class="content"><p>The design process for Outshape has been insanely iterative. I've gone back and forth and shifted the visual style of various aspects as I've gone along. </p>

<p>Initial designs of the app were made with a dark background. At the time, I was really big into the darker background on Reeder.</p>

<div class="screens">
<img class="screen" src="/images/Board1.png" alt="First Mock"/>
<img class="screen" alt="Refined Version" src="/images/Board2.png"/>
<img class="screen" alt="Main Menu" src="/images/Main%20Menu.png"/>
</div>

<p>The modal-ish views in the app were making heavy use of translucency, as it seemed like the cool thing to do in the earlier days of iOS 7. This was before iOS 8 brought decent APIs, so my solutions for implementing these designs were a bit hacky.</p>

<div class="screens">
<img class="screen" src="/images/Friends%26Powerups.png" alt="Settings"/>
<img class="screen" src="/images/New%20Match.png" alt="New Match"/>
<img class="screen" src="/images/Powerups.png" alt="Powerups"/>
</div>

<p>It's been a long road of missteps and mind changing, so I'm honestly not sure if these next mocks were just a step in the direction of the previous mocks, or a push back against translucency and gradients that led me to the current design. I <em>think</em> it was the latter, but I'm not positive. Regardless, as much as I liked that look, I didn't think it fit the style I was trying to hit.</p>

<div class="screens">
<img class="screen" src="/images/Settings.png" alt="Settings"/>
<img class="screen" src="/images/No%20Games.png" alt="Main Menu"/>
</div>

<p>I took that stark white look, and spent a lot of time figuring out how to work color into it. There was a moment when I was working on the app late one night and <a href="https://justgetflux.com">f.lux</a> had really warmed the colors on my monitor. It dawned on e that I loved what it had done to the app. It looked so much nicer with warmer blues and reds and an offwhite background. So I spend some good time warming up the color palette.</p>

<div class="screens">
<img class="screen" src="/images/UpdatedGameBoard.png" alt="Game Board"/>
<img class="screen" src="/images/UpdatedHome.png" alt="Home"/>
</div>

<p>One of the last design changes I've made is to give the app a little bit of depth. It was always meant to have a simple aesthetic. But I feel like I went too far and it was lacking in any sort of affordances. I've tweaked the buttons to make it clear they're buttons. And I'm still doing some iterating to find places where the design is lacking depth.</p>

<div class="screens">
<img class="screen" src="/images/IMG_0218.jpg" alt="Powerups"/>
</div>

<p>The path to Outshape's current design has been years long and full of a lot of ugly. But I think you guys are going to like the final product. And the mocks are an incomplete representation, because the app isn't complete with animations and transitions. But more on that later...</p></div></div><div class="post"><h1 class="post__title"><a href="inspiration">Inspiration</a></h1><span class="post__date">4/15/2015</span><div class="content"><p>Outshape was really born out of a love for a couple different iOS games. When the urge to make a game hit me, I was playing a lot of <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dots-a-game-about-connecting/id632285588?mt=8/">Dots</a> and <a href="http://www.atebits.com/letterpress/">Letterpress</a>. What I really started with was the desire to make sort of a two player version of Dots. I wanted to meld those two awesome games into something but I didn't really know what that something looked like.</p>

<h2 id="theinspirers">The Inspirers</h2>

<p>If you're not familiar with Dots, it's a fun little game where you basically draw paths to destroy colored dots. </p>

<p>Letterpress, on the other hand, is a two player word game. You're given a grid of letters and each player takes turns making words with those letters, and by using letters you take control of the tiles. The game ends when the whole board is controlled and whoever controls the most tiles, wins.</p>

<h2 id="thegame">The Game</h2>

<p>In the first versions of the game, it was almost impossible to describe how to play. You had to draw lines between dots and never touch the same color of dot consecutively. Two players took turns drawing lines, and the game ended when all of the dots had been claimed. This was how the game functioned for almost a year I think. Looking back it seems annoyingly complicated.</p>

<p><img src="/images/IMG_0197.jpg" alt="An early mind dump for the game" title="" /></p>

<div class="caption">An early mind dump for the game</div>

<p>I can't remember what sparked the thought, but I realized the game would be way simpler if your turns were restricted to having to draw simple shapes. The game totally changed (har har) when I went down that path. I knew that was what the game would be and everything since then has been refinement and iteration.</p>

<h2 id="goodartistscopygreatartistssteal">Good artists copy, great artists steal</h2>

<p>Outshape is a game inspired by the ideas of other awesome games. But I have this crippling fear that people will look at it and say "It's just a Dots clone". Or even worse, that the Dots developers will feel ripped off. Every time those imposter syndrome-y thoughts pop into my head, I remind myself that I've spent <em>hundreds</em> of hours designing, tweaking, developing, and playing this game. Like many things, it was inspired by those that came before it. But I think (or hope at least) it stands pretty well on it's own.</p></div></div><div class="post"><h1 class="post__title"><a href="welcome">Welcome</a></h1><span class="post__date">4/8/2014</span><div class="content"><p>Welcome to the Outshape blog. Over the next few weeks I'm going to write a series of posts about the process of building Outshape. I'm going to share some mocks and design bits. I'm going to talk about aspects of game play. And I'm hoping to share some of the future plans as well. I might even ask for some input on a few decisions I'm mulling over.</p>

<p>You can follow those blog posts here or you can head over to the <a href="/outshape/">landing page</a> to sign up for the email list. I'm hoping to get folks on the email list at launch some free in app powerups and some Outshape swag (who doesn't love stickers...). If that's not doable I will definitely find a way to thank you for your support.</p>
