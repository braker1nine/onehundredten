At One Hundred Ten, LLC we have a few fundamental principles:</p><ul><li>We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it.</li><li>We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.</li><li>We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.</li></ul><h2>iOS App Users</h2><p>Like many apps, <em>One Hundred Ten</em> collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that devices typically make available, such as the device version, OS version, language preference, and the date and time of each visitor request. One Hundred Ten&#39;s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how our users use our apps. From time to time, <em>One Hundred Ten</em> may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p><p><em>One Hundred Ten</em> also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, third party user identifiers, and location for logged in users in our apps. <em>One Hundred Ten</em> only discloses logged in user IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.</p><h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2><p>We keep our gathering of personally identifying information to an absolute minimum. When you login through third party services (Facebook, Twitter, Digits), only small bits of user information are stored which allow you to log in in the future and find your friends on the service. This data is stored encrypted on our servers so that noone else may access it and will not be shared with third parties.</p><h2>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h2><p><em>One Hundred Ten</em> discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on One Hundred Ten&#39;s behalf, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using <em>One Hundred Ten&#39;s</em> apps, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. <em>One Hundred Ten</em> will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, <em>One Hundred Ten</em> discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when <em>One Hundred Ten</em> believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of <em>One Hundred Ten</em>, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of a <em>One Hundred Ten</em> app and have supplied your email address, <em>One Hundred Ten</em> may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with <em>One Hundred Ten</em> and our products. We primarily use our blog and social media to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. <em>One Hundred Ten</em> takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p><p>If <em>One Hundred Ten</em>, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that <em>One Hundred Ten</em> goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of <em>One Hundred Ten</em> may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p><h2>Privacy Policy Changes</h2><p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, <em>One Hundred Ten</em> may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in <em>One Hundred Ten&#39;s</em> sole discretion. <em>One Hundred Ten</em> encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p></div></div><div class="footer"><h2>Who is One Hundred Ten?</h2><div class="owner"><img src="/images/avatar_512.jpg" class="avatar"/><h4 class="name">Chris Brakebill</h4><p>I'm a developer with several years experience building web and mobile apps.
